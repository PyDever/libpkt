# libpkt

libpkt is a simple packet manipulation library for Python. It is specially designed to
efficiently handle TCP/IP packets. 

```
$ make build
```

NOTE: libpkt only runs on UNIX systems!

```python
>>> import libpkt
>>> import socket
>>> import random

>>> # build your own packet
>>> pkt = libpkt.IP(src_ip=socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()), 
                dst_ip=socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
                ip_id=1503327, d_hdr=random._urandom(1024))
>>> pkt.d_hdr
�������G�2���;�/ꖛK]�Hhu��y���jo��*�����31%ő��.���8F�Aq5�y����kXUUtG�SҠ��«T�Ġk�lɆ��M��D%�qBn��_˝P�{?�L��r-x��X����,@�+��^>|;ЍA�vJ+g�

>>> pkt.src_ip
'127.0.1.1'

>>> pkt.dst_ip 
'127.0.1.1'

>>> # print the entire packed packet
>>> pkt.bin
�������G�2���;�/ꖛK]�Hhu��y���jo��*�����31%ő��.���8F�Aq5�y����kXUUtG�SҠ��«T�Ġk�lɆ��M��D%�qBn��_˝P�{?�L��r-x��X����,@�+��^>|;ЍA�vJ+g��������G�2����������G�2���;�/ꖛK]�Hhu��y���jo��*�����31%ő��.���8F�Aq5�y����kXUUtG�SҠ��«T�Ġk�lɆ��M��D%�qBn��_˝P�{?�L��r-x��X����,@�+��^>|;ЍA�vJ+g�
```
The `IP.bin` object is actually an `@property` method. This object is what you 
use to send a TCP/IP packet in raw form.

```python
>>> psock = libpkt.PSocket(timeout=10)
>>> psock.sendp(pkt.bin, dst_ip=pkt.dst_ip, dst_p=80)
True
```


  * ***fast*** packet capture algorithm
  * ***fast*** packing and unpacking
  * efficient data injection
  * ***faster*** THAN SCAPY!
